# Project_Game_development_FindYourHat

**Developer:** Emmanuel Moulun <br>
**Project Type:** Codecademy project - www.codecademy.com

### Description
The goal of this game is to find your path ('#') to your hat ('^').
The field is composed of holes ('O') that you have to avoid.
The program ensures that when the field is generated, the player's starting position and the hat are not too close.
After turn 3, a new hole will be randomly added to the field (care is taken to not add it on an already existing hole, path, or hat).
It uses some object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like parent and child classes, inheritance, and methods.
### Technologie:
